 Age Status Checker:
Ask the user to input their age (positive numbers only). Validate the input and then classify the user's status based on age ranges:

Child: 1-10
Teenager: 11-18
Grown-up: 19-50
Old: 50 and above
Keep prompting for age until the user clicks cancel.
2. Vowel Counter:
Prompt the user to input a string, then count and display the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in that string. For instance, if the input is "example," the output would be: a=1, e=2, i=0, o=0, u=0.

3. 24-Hour to 12-Hour Clock Conversion:
Create a JavaScript program that converts a 24-hour clock time to the 12-hour format and adds 'AM' or 'PM' accordingly. Examples:

0 -> 12AM
11 -> 11AM
13 -> 1PM
4. Finding the Largest Number:
Ask the user to input three numbers. Create a JavaScript program to find and display the largest among those three numbers.
